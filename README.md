# CS465-Full-Stack-Dev-I

**Architecture:**

_"Compare and contrast the types of frontend development you used in your full stack project, including Express HTML, JavaScript, and the single-page application (SPA). Why did the backend use NoSQL MongoDB database?"_


**Functionality:**

_"How is JSON different from Javascript and how does JSON tie together the frontend and backend development pieces? Provide instances in the full stack process when you refactored code to improve functionality and efficiencies, and name the benefits that come from resuable user interface (UI) components."_


**Testing**

_"Methods for request and retrieval necessitate various types of API testing endpoints, in addition to the difficulties of testing with added layers of security. Explain your understandings of methods, endpoints, and security in a full stack application."_


**Reflection**

_"How has this course helped you in reaching your professional goals? What skill shave you learned, developed, or mastered in this course to help you become a more marketable candidate in your career field?"_
